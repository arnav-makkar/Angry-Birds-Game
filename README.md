# AP Project

Angry Birds Game GUI developed using LibGDX and Java by Aryamaan Singh (2023139) and Arnav Makkar (2023127). Course Project for Advanced Programming Course, CSE-201, Monsoon'24.

All possible GUI use cases and user requirements have been implemented.

We implemented a Home Screen consisting of a “play” button ,”settings” button and an “exit” button.

On clicking the “play” button we enter the Level Screen where we can choose the level of our choice using the “level@“ button where @=1..4

The “Settings” button leads us to the settings page where we can alter the “volume” and “brightness” slider to our needs and also a “back” button to return to Home Screen
